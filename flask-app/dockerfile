# flask-app/Dockerfile
# This Dockerfile builds the image for your Flask application.
# It installs necessary dependencies and sets up the Flask app.

# Use a slim Python base image
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file and install dependencies
# This step is optimized for Docker caching: if requirements.txt doesn't change,
# this layer can be reused.
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the Flask application code
COPY app.py .

# Expose the port Flask will listen on
EXPOSE 5000
